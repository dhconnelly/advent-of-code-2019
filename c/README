prerequisites:

    - a c compiler
    - gnu make

to run tests:

    make test

to run a solution (make sure the input is saved as inputs/dayN.txt):

    make dayN && ./target/dayN inputs/dayN.txt

to build and run remotely on the host $REMOTE_DEPLOY_HOST in the
directory $REMOTE_DEPLOY_PATH:

your local and remote ssh configs should allow login without a password
with `ssh $REMOTE_DEPLOY_HOST`, i.e. using certificates
